Black Panther 3 Year Strike Price Calculator
>>Requirements, Windows 10.
>>Or PowerShell for the BlackPanther.ps1 script

But basically, you download the .exe Click on it. Type you Ticker Symbol. And hit D for your Strike price, and that's it.

Works on Windows 10, and tested on Windows 10 x64 only. Calculates Strike Price based on @iamMarkMonroe's strike technique.
